    "# Week 3 - Cleaning data\n",
    "Eighty percent of the time you spend creating a machine learning model will be in cleaning and finding features to use to improve your model.  This week you will learn to explore your data set.\n",
    "The first step in the process will be examining the data set.  You can ask the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the target variable.  This is the variable you want to predict.\n",
    "2. Are there any missing values in the target variable?  Should we drop those records from the data set?  Theses questions should be asked of the\n",
    "   stakeholders of the project.  If you are doing a supervised machine learning project.  Then the records without target variables should be\n",
    "   eliminated.  However, if you are fitting a unsupervised model than it may not matter.\n",
    "3. Does all the records have the appropriate values in the columns?  If not, can we determine what should be in the column or will we replace\n",
    "   the value in the column?\n",
    "4. Having a subject matter expert on the predictive modeling team will be of great use when answering these question.\n",
    "5. If the model is a supervised model, is it a regression or classification model.  You can always take a regression model and change it to a \n",
    "   classification model. However, it is not easy to go the opposite direction.\n",

The large number of nights indicates the property requires upto 15+ years when booking it.  The stakeholder will determine if the high minimum nights for properties should not be included in the model.\n",

    "8. The **review rate ranges** from 1 through 5 which is reasonable.\n",
